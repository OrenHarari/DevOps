# AML Microservice Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines a microservice architecture for an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) system, incorporating key design patterns and components to ensure scalability, reliability, and security.

## Core Components

### 1. API Gateway
- **Function**: Central entry point for all client requests
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Request routing
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Rate limiting
  - Request/response transformation

### 2. User Management Service
- **Function**: Manages user data and profiles
- **Features**:
  - User registration and KYC processing
  - Profile updates
  - Data provision to other services

### 3. AML Analysis Service
- **Function**: Core AML detection and prevention
- **Features**:
  - Transaction analysis using rules and AI models
  - Risk flagging for manual review
  - Integration with external data sources

### 4. Notification Service
- **Function**: Alerts and communication
- **Features**:
  - Multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, push)
  - Template-based message generation
  - Notification scheduling and tracking

### 5. Authentication Service
- **Function**: Security and access control
- **Features**:
  - User authentication
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Token management

## Data Management

### Database per Service Pattern
- Each microservice maintains its own database
- Ensures data isolation and service independence
- Databases:
  - User DB
  - AML DB
  - Notification DB
  - Auth DB

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Separate read and write operations for optimized performance
- Implement for high-volume services like AML Analysis

## Observability and Monitoring

### Logging System
- Centralized log collection and analysis
- Use tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

### Monitoring (Prometheus)
- Real-time metrics collection and alerting
- Integration with Grafana for visualization

### Health Check API
- Each service exposes a /health endpoint
- Regular polling by monitoring system

### Distributed Tracing
- Implement using tools like Jaeger or Zipkin
- Track requests across services for performance analysis

## Resilience Patterns

### Circuit Breaker
- Implement using libraries like Hystrix
- Prevent cascading failures in service communications

### Saga Pattern
- Manage distributed transactions across services
- Implement compensating transactions for rollbacks

## Scalability and Performance

- Use containerization (Docker) for easy deployment and scaling
- Implement auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
- Use caching mechanisms (Redis) for frequently accessed data

## Security Considerations

- Implement end-to-end encryption for all communications
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Strict access controls and principle of least privilege

## Future Enhancements

- Machine Learning Pipeline for advanced AML detection
- Blockchain integration for enhanced transaction tracing
- Real-time reporting dashboard for AML officers

## Conclusion

This microservice architecture provides a robust foundation for an AML system, offering scalability, resilience, and flexibility. Regular reviews and updates will ensure the system evolves with changing regulatory requirements and technological advancements.
